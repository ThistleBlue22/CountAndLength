Many different software packages exist to program and develop games within. Many share similar features and other have completely unique features packed in with the software. This project aims to compare two packages that are more aimed at smaller developers and, in some cases, one-man developers. The two chosen software packages are Unity, a free and paid game engine that has been used in the smallest and the biggest games. From Hollow Knight, a metroidvania (portmanteau of Metroid and Castlevania, two game franchises) Indie title from developer Team Cherry to Hearthstone, a collectible card game based on World of Warcraft by Blizzard Entertainment and GameMaker Studio which many smaller games and smaller developers use. Such games include Risk of Rain, a roguelite (a genre where one or more aspect is random) platformer from a small 2-man team and Hyper Light Drifter, a 2D Action RPG by a 9-person team.



In the case of this project I shall be focusing on a 2D game as it will allow for comparison of features within the two engines while also giving enough time to complete the actual dissertation without any time issues from arising. Unity can make both 2D and 3D games easily, however GameMaker is more 2D oriented in the games that can be made from it, however 3D isnâ€™t entirely impossible.



Research into the two software packages will be performed before taking an action in designing and creating the games to ensure the proper creation of a working game. The main focus of the research will be on that of the two engines and, to a lesser extent, game design.



Analysis of the two development processes comparing them based on advantages and disadvantages of the two software packages will also be tracked and included as another source of comparison between the two engines.



Comparing the two for functionality of both scripting languages used for each engine. Included shall be ease of use, learning curve and the power the two bring for each environment. Comparison between the two games performance wise by adding in a bunch of items onto a level/screen of the game.



Scripting will be performed to provide more functionality to the game world. Use of C# for Unity and Game Maker Language (GML) for GameMaker Studio. They each have differences between their structure, and variables where GML have set variables, the ability to set sound, path, script etc. and also allows the normal creation of variables, through normal means.
